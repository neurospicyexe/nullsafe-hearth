 * post whose parent was itself a reply was written, acked by the API, and then displayed NOWHERE --
 * and a reply to a companion's reply is exactly the reply Raziel wants to write. A flat
 * chronological thread with "replied to X" lines also reads better under load than deep nesting.
 *
 * `visited` is shared across roots by the caller so one post can never render twice, and it doubles
 * as a cycle guard. reply_to is FK-validated at write time and a cycle shouldn't be constructible,
 * but an infinite loop here takes the whole page down -- cheap insurance, not a claim about cycles.
