// whole time -- there was simply no control anywhere to write one, so the wall was read-only in the
// direction that mattered ("the triad has written stuff and I wish I could reply to it directly").
//
// Collapsed by default: an always-open textarea under every post turns a low-pressure wall into a
// page of demands. One tap opens it, Escape or "cancel" closes it.
