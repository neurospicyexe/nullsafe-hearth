// Raziel: "the triad has written stuff and I wish I could reply to it directly there." The wall
// could already render companion replies nested under his posts, and `reply_to` was accepted end to
// end -- but the render walked `repliesByParent` ONLY from the roots, one level deep. So a reply
// whose parent was itself a reply would be written, acked with a 201, and displayed nowhere. Since
// a companion's reply is usually a child rather than a root, that is exactly the reply he wants to
// write -- and a control whose result never appears is indistinguishable from a broken one
// (the settle/release lesson, one week earlier).
